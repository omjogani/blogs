## Introduction
Guide How They do product development at Basecamp. 
### Growing Pains
When software teams start to grow some common struggles appear:
- Team members feel like project go on, with no end in sight.
- Product Managers can't find time to think strategically about the product.
- Founders ask themselves: "Why can't we get features out the door like we used to in the early days?"

There were tons of challenges faced by Basecamp, with trial and errors they figured out techniques that actually worked for the Basecamp.
Three people built the first version of the product, Json Fried, Basecamp's Founder, led the design, His co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), programmed it (and created the well-known web framework Ruby on Rails as a by-product). Third one was a web designer focused on usability and user interfaces.

From the first prototype in July 2003 to launch in February 2004, David only worked ten hours a week and that was no enough. So the third person jumped into the programming world keeping his one foot in designing and one foot in programming world.
Here is the overview of the main ideas from the book.

### Six-week cycles
At base they work in six-week cycles.
- Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline is far from the start, so they use the time wisely.
- Decisions are also based on moving the product forward in the next six weeks, not micromanaging time.
- Not counting hours OR focusing on how individual spent their days.
- No daily meetings
- No rethink their road-map every two weeks.
- Instead their focus is at the higher level, They say "If this project ships after six weeks, we'll be really happy".

### Shaping the work
- They shape the work before giving it to a team. A small senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams.They define the key element of a solution before they consider a project ready to bet on.
- Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves.
- When Shaping, They focus less on estimates and more on their appetite. Instead of asking: "How much time it will take to do some work?", they ask "How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth?" This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the problems and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our appetite.

### Making teams responsible
- They give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. They define their own tasks, make adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time. Very different where managers chop up the work and programmer acts as ticket takers.
- When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing them, with less time on management, senior people can shape up better projects.
- When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.

### Targeting risk
- At every step of the process they target a specific risk: the risk of not shipping on time.
- Improving your discovery process should come after regaining your ability to ship. e.g. You have best strategy in the world, but if you can't act on it, what good does it do?
- This is about risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting bogged down in previous quarter's work, wasting time on unexpected problems, and being free to do what you want to do tomorrow.
- They reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions before they commit the project to a time box.
- They reduce risk in the planning process by capping their bets to six weeks. If project runs over it won't get extension. Their "circuit-breaker" ensure that they don't invest unnecessary time on something that needs rethinking first.
- They reduce risk in the building process by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building lots of disconnected parts and hoping they'll fit together in the 11th hour, They built one meaningful piece of work end-to-end and repeat it.

Part One of this book is all about **Shaping** - the pre-work they do on projects before consider them ready to schedule.

Part Two of this book is all about **Betting** - how they choose among the pitched projects and decide what to do six weeks at a time.

Part Three of this book is all about **Building** - the expectation they place on the teams and the special practices they use to discover what to do.  

## Principle of Shaping

![principle-of-shaping](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608c0620-516c-41fa-a66e-5e37ab70f81d)

When we share the work we need to find the right balance, not too vague and not too concrete.

### Wireframes are too concrete
- When design leaders go straight to wireframes or high-fidelity mockups, they defines too much details too early. This leaves designers no room for creativity.
- Over-specifying the designs also leads to estimation errors. The more specific the work is, the harder it can be to estimate.
- When the scope isn't variable, the team can't reconsider a design decision that is turning out to cost more than it's worth.

### Words are too abstract
- On the other side, Projects that are too vague don't work either. When a project is defined in a few words, nobody knows what it means. eg. "build a calendar view" or "add group notifications". Team member don't have enough information to make a trade-offs. A Programmer who worked in this situation said:

>You're solving a problem with no context. You have to be a mind reader. It's like: â€œwe'll know it when we see it.
{: .prompt-info }

- Concerning estimation, under-specified projects naturally grow out of control. because there's no boundary to define what's out of scope.

### Case Study: The Dot Grid Calendar
In version three of Basecamp calendar it had "schedule" features and customers started asking for daily, weekly or monthly calendar view. They knew how complex they are. It can easily take six months or more to build a proper calendar (There was no AI back then).

There are the kinds of things that make a calendar complicated: Dragging and dropping event feature, color coding events, wrapping multi-day events, handling different expectations for desktop vs mobile interactions etc.

Past version of Basecamp has calendars, and only about 10% of customers used them. That's why they didn't have the `appetite` for spending six months on a calendar.

With only six weeks to work with, They could only build about a tenth of what people think of when they say "calendar." The question became: which tenth?

They did some research and narrow down the use case that they wanted to solve. They could build a two-month, read-only grid view. Any day with an event would have a dot for each event. List of events will appear below the calendar, and clicking on the a dot would scroll the events for that day into view. They called it Dot Grid.

The Dot Grid wasn't a full-featured calendar. They weren't going to allow dragging events between days or multi-day events or color coding events etc. They were comfortable with all these trade-offs because of their understanding of the use case.

This is the level of fidelity they used to define the solution:

![rough-sketching-fidelity-level](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98d0b5c9-8ed8-4eef-8713-d202f889655e)

Now designer had a lot of room to be creative and interpret how this should look and feel.

At the same time note how specific the idea is, It's very clear how it works, what needs to be built, what's in and what's out.

End result from designer to and programmer looked like this:

This small example highlights a few properties of shaped work.

### Property 1: It's rough
- Work in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking at it that it's unfinished.
- Everyone finds something to improve or contribute.
- Designers and programmers need room to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up their sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge.

### Property 2: It's solved
- Despite being rough and unfinished, shaped work has been thought through. In short it should be solvable.
- All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together.
- While surprises might still happen and icebergs could still emerge, there is clear direction showing what to do.
- Any question, rabbit holes they could see up front have been removed to reduce the project's risk.

### Property 3: It's bounded
- Lastly, shaped work indicate what not to do. It tell the team where to stop.
- There is a specific appetite - the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving specific things out.
- The roughness laves room for the team to resolve all the details and be creative in the solution, while the solution and boundaries act as guard rails.
- They reduce risk and channel the team's effort making sure not spending too much time or get stuck.

### Who shapes
- Shaping is creative and integrative. It requires combining interface ideas with technical possibilities with business priorities.
- Shaping is primarily design work. The shaped concept is an interaction design viewed from the user's perspective. It defines what the feature does, how it works, and where it fits into existing flow.
- You don't need to be programmer to shape, but you need to be technically literate. You should be able to judge what' s possible, what's easy and what's hard.
- Its' also strategic work. Setting the appetite and coming up with a solution requires you to be critical about the problem. What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?
- Shaping is a closed door, creative process. You might be alone sketching on paper or in front of a whiteboard with a close collaborator.
- When working with a collaborator, you move fast, speak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It's that kind of private rough, early work.

### Two tracks
- You can't really schedule shaping work because, by it's very nature, unshaped work is risky and unknown. For that reason we have two separate tracks: one for shaping, one for building.
- Dusting any six week cycle, the teams are building work that's been previously shaped and shapers are working on the what the team will build in future cycle.
- Work on the shaping track is kept private and not shared with wider team unless commitment has been made to bet on it.
- It gives liberty to shapers to drop it when it's not working out.

### Steps to shaping
Shaping has four main steps:
1. **Set boundaries**: Figure out how much time the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem. this gives us the basic boundaries to shape into.
2. **Rough out the elements**: Creative work of sketching a solution. We do this at a higher level of abstraction then wireframe in order to move faster. The output of this step is an idea that solves the problem within the appetite but without all the fine details worked out.
3. **Address risks and rabbit holes**: Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find the holes and unanswered questions that could trip up the team. We modify the solution, cut things out or answer some tricky question if required to prevent team getting stuck or wasting time.
4. **Write the pitch**: Once we think we've shaped it enough to potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called `pitch`. It summarize the problem, constrains, solution, rabbit holes and limitations. The pitch can be used to explain the  project to the team if the project gets chosen.

## Set Boundaries
The first step of shaping is setting boundaries on what we're trying to do. The conversation about building a features always starts with a raw idea, like "customers are asking for group notification". It should be at abstract or in board terms on the discussion to make it productive.

### Setting the Appetite
Sometimes an idea gets excited right away, in this case we should determine that whether this is really something we're going to able to invest time in or not. If we don't stop to think about how valuable the idea is, we move towards nowhere.

Other ideas are less exciting and feel more like a challenge we didn't ask for. The customer wants calendar; we don't particularly want to build one, but we do feel we need to do something about the request.

Thinking about the value of the idea helped to define how much of our time and attention the subject deserves. Is this something worth a quick fix if we can manage? Is it a big idea worth an entire cycle?

We call this `appetite`. You can think of the appetite as a time budget for a standard team size. They usually set the appetite in two sizes:
- **Small Batch**: This is a project that a team of one designer and one or two programmers can build in one or two weeks. We batch these together into a `six week` cycle.
- **Big Batch**: This project takes the same-size team a full six-weeks.

In rare cases where the scope is so big that six-week project isn't enough. If that is the case they will try to hammer it down by narrowing the problem definition.
If they still can't shrink the scope, they will break off a meaningful part of the project that we can shape to a six-week appetite.

### Fixed time, variable scope
An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and ends with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design.

This principle, called "**fixed time, variable scope**" is a key to successfully defining and shipping projects. For example: It's hard to publish article when you can always add more to it. When you have a deadline, you have to make a decision, either you add new section in the blog or fix grammar. That's the tension between time, quality and scope. If scope wasn't variable we won't make a trade-off.

We apply this principle at each stage of the process, from shaping potential projects to building and shipping them.
- First, the appetite constrains what kind of solution they design during the shaping process.
- Later, They hand the work to a team, fixed time box pushes them to make a decision (trade-off) about what to achieve.

### "Good" is relative
Good doesn't have it's definition. Without a time limit, there's always a better version. The ultimate meal might be ten course dinner but when you're hungry and in a hurry, a hot dog is perfect.

The amount of time we set for our appetite is going to lead us to different solutions. We could redesign the main landing page to accommodate a new feature,  or we could push it back to a screen with fewer design constraints.

We can only judge what is a "good" solution in the context of how much time we want to spend and how important it is

### Responding to raw ideas
Not each idea needs to be go in backlog, sometimes saying soft "no" can open up options to think about importance of the idea and what it might add value.

It's too early to say "Yes" or "No" on first contact. We shouldn't make a early even if idea is exciting. We need to do work on the idea before it's shaped enough to bet resources on. If we always say "yes" to incoming requests we'll end up increasing stack in the backlog.

It's important to keep a cool manner and a bit of poker face. We also want to welcome the ideas at the same time showing too much enthusiasm right way can set expectations that this thing is going to happen.

### Narrow down the problem
In addition to setting the appetite, we usually need to narrow down our understanding of the problem.

Consider the calendar view example, If they only want to spend six weeks instead of six months building a huge calendar, how do they narrow it down?

In that case they flip from asking "What could we build?" to "What's really going wrong?".

### Case study: Defining "calendar"
When they got the having a calendar request, instead of asking Why she wants a calendar and what should it looks like, they asked her when she wanted a calendar. What was she doing when the thought occurred to ask for it?

She worked in an office with a big calendar drawn on a chalkboard wall. Everyone puts their client meeting there. When she was working from home, she had hard time searching for free slot for her client. She has to drive to the office to look for free slot. She could have saved hours just to get free slots.

This story was important to derive what is really necessary, Here what they learned was that "see free spaces" was the important thing for this use case, not "do everything a calendar does".

They narrow down the need from "do everything a calendar does" to "help me see free spaces so I can figure out when to schedule something". That's how they built "Dot Grid Calendar".

**What if we can't figure out a specific pain point or use case?**

Out Appetite can also tell us how much research is worthwhile. If it's not critical now and we can't get hands around the problem, leave it and may be work on something else. Maybe in the future a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insights into the problem.

### Watch out for grab-bags
When it comes to unclear ideas, the worst offenders are "redesigns" or "refactorings" that aren't driven by a single problem or use case. when someone proposes something like "redesign the files section", that's a grab-bag, not a project. It's hard to figure out what it mean, when it starts, when it ends.

Here is more productive starting point: "We need to rethink the Files section because sharing multiple files takes too many steps". Now we can start asking what's not working?

A tell-tale sign of a grab-bag is the "2.0" label. They faced the issue of tagging their project as "2.0" without thinking much about what they were going to do. The project turned out to be a mess because they didn't know what "done" looked like.

### Boundaries in place
When we have all three things - a raw idea, an appetite, and a narrow problem definition - We're ready to move to the next step and define the element of a solution.
